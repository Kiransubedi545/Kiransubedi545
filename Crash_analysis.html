    <p>
      In 2024, over 900,000 traffic crashes in Chicago were analyzed using CPD data and Python-based tools to uncover key trends and safety challenges. Notably, more than 700,000 crashes occurred under clear weather, highlighting the dominant role of driver behavior, infrastructure, and traffic volume over adverse weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crashes peaked in October, especially between 3â€“5 PM, with parked vehicle collisions and rear-end crashes being most common. Vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists faced higher injury risks, and over half the crashes occurred in areas lacking traffic controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study emphasizes the need for targeted interventions, improved traffic management, and better data reporting to enhance road safety citywide.
