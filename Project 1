        <h3>Seismic Analysis and Design of Earthquake Resistance Structural Building</h3>
        <p>This project work was intended to learn the structural analysis and seismic resistant design of Residential building. It was mainly based on the structural analysis using SAP-2000 and manual design of structural elements for the analysis using different design codes as per requirement. In the analysis of seismic resistant design of the building, the negative moment in beam was greater than that of the positive moment, as a result of which, the under- reinforced design of beam made it inevitable to provide more reinforcement as a top bar than as a bottom bar. Hence, this high negative moment in beam which demanded high reinforcement on the top fiber, especially near the joints, was due to the earthquake consideration in the analysis and design of the structure. In the same way, the spacing of the lateral bars near the support and at the centre of the beam and column. More importantly, the behavior of structure with respect to the seismicity could be learned from the design of column. It was concluded that the columns in the periphery of the whole building are more critical to high moment and the columns in the central portion are more critical to high axial load. as we move one storey above, the axial load and moments developed therein are also reduced comparatively. As a result of which the demand of the reinforcement is also decreased comparatively.
The analysis design and detailing of all structural members is required to complete the entire design but due to unavailability of time only calculation for the design of critical member is presented here. Rest of the member can be designed by following the same procedure.
