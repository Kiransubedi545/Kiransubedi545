    <p>This project work was intended to learn the structural analysis and seismic resistant design of a residential building. It was mainly based on the structural analysis using SAP-2000 and manual design of structural elements as per different design codes.</p>
    <p>The seismic design revealed that the negative moment in beams was greater than the positive moment. This led to under-reinforced beam sections needing more top reinforcement, especially at joints. The column design helped understand structural behavior under seismic loads, with edge columns being more critical in moments and central ones in axial load.</p>
    <p>With increasing storey height, both axial load and moment reduce, and so does the reinforcement requirement. Due to limited time, only critical members were detailed, but the same procedure can be applied to the rest.</p>
