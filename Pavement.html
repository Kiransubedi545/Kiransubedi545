    <p>The evolution of road infrastructure is increasingly driven by the need for sustainability, resilience, and intelligent systems. This study explores the transformative shift from traditional flexible pavements to advanced smart pavement technologies.</p>
    <p>It provides a comparative analysis of Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA), Warm-Mix Asphalt (WMA), and Cold-Mix Asphalt (CMA), highlighting their environmental impacts, application conditions, and structural performance. Innovations such as bio-binders and recycled materials are examined for their potential in enhancing bitumen properties and reducing ecological footprints.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, alternative pavement types like inverted pavements and Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements (ICBP) are discussed for their structural benefits and adaptability to urban environments. The core focus lies on smart pavements, including self-healing asphalt and concrete, energy-harvesting surfaces, and sensor-integrated structures that enable real-time data interaction and proactive maintenance.</p>
    <p>Challenges related to durability, cost, and implementation of these technologies are also considered. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing smart pavement systems to meet future transportation demands sustainably and intelligently.</p>
