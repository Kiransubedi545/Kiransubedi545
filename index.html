                            <h3>Seismic Analysis and Design of Earthquake Resistance Structural Building</h3>
                            <p>This project work was intended to learn the structural analysis and seismic resistant design of Residential building. It was mainly based on the structural analysis using SAP-2000 and manual design of structural elements for the analysis using different design codes as per requirement. In the analysis of seismic resistant design of the building, the negative moment in beam was greater than that of the positive moment, as a result of which, the under- reinforced design of beam made it inevitable to provide more reinforcement as a top bar than as a bottom bar. Hence, this high negative moment in beam which demanded high reinforcement on the top fiber, especially near the joints, was due to the earthquake consideration in the analysis and design of the structure. In the same way, the spacing of the lateral bars near the support and at the centre of the beam and column. More importantly, the behavior of structure with respect to the seismicity could be learned from the design of column. It was concluded that the columns in the periphery of the whole building are more critical to high moment and the columns in the central portion are more critical to high axial load. as we move one storey above, the axial load and moments developed therein are also reduced comparatively. As a result of which the demand of the reinforcement is also decreased comparatively.
The analysis design and detailing of all structural members is required to complete the entire design but due to unavailability of time only calculation for the design of critical member is presented here. Rest of the member can be designed by following the same procedure.

                            <h3>Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Road and Bridge Projects under Road Division Pokhara.</h3>
                            <p>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has caused social disruption and altered the global economic perspective. The construction sector plays an essential role in the worldwide economy, drawing upon a diverse array of resources within regional economies. Since the COVID-19 outburst in Nepal, it has been a really difficult task for the construction sector to initiate a project or to continue running at a normal pace. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the road and bridge project under the road division Pokhara. About 52 respondents comprised contractors and client/consulting agencies at different structure questionnaires compatible with the requirement of the study were recorded. As a result, the eight most important factors were ranked based on the severity of the effect and prioritization of multiple factors on the project due to the pandemic. Obtained responses from consultant and contractor representatives, it was found that the factors beyond the control of projects, transportation shutdown were ranked first followed by the shortage of labor under manpower factor and others. This paper observes the actual severity of the various factors regarding construction projects due to the corona virus and will also lead to better management in upcoming pandemics. The results of this study establish the groundwork for future researchers and practitioners by offering suggestions for how to prioritize and re-organize work plans, workplace management, and strategies for unforeseen circumstances..</p>

                <h3>Transforming Road Infrastructure: The Rise of Smart Pavements 🌍</h3>
                <p>
                    As we venture into an era defined by technological innovation, the evolution of road infrastructure emerges as a critical axis for progress. Smart pavements, by integrating cutting-edge technologies, hold the potential to redefine the landscape of transportation. From self-healing surfaces that autonomously extend pavement life, to energy-harvesting systems that transform daily foot and vehicle traffic into sustainable energy sources, the future of roadways promises to be both resilient and eco-conscious. Cooling pavements aim to mitigate urban heat, while smart sensors offer real-time data, optimizing traffic flow and enhancing road safety. These developments are not merely incremental improvements but represent a paradigm shift toward sustainable, intelligent infrastructure. The convergence of these technologies will likely drive the next generation of transportation, where environmental stewardship and efficiency are seamlessly intertwined. As this transformation unfolds, it invites an urgent dialogue on how we, as a society, can accelerate the adoption and refinement of these innovations for a smarter, safer, and more sustainable future.

                <h3>Chicago Crash Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2024, traffic crashes across Chicago’s city streets were closely examined using data from the Chicago Police Department (CPD), sourced through Data.gov. This analysis finds a detailed picture of the city’s road safety challenges and opportunities for improvement. Every year, more than 900,000 crashes occur, and a striking insight is that over 700,000 of these accidents take place under clear weather conditions. This suggests that factors such as driver behavior, traffic volume, and infrastructure play a far larger role in accidents than adverse weather conditions. Breaking this down further, it means that on average, about 2,500 crashes happen each day, with the majority occurring when visibility and road conditions are optimal. This emphasizes the need to focus on improving road safety through better traffic management, enhanced driver education, and infrastructure improvements rather than solely focusing on weather-related risks.
