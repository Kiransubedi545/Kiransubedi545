        <p class="text-muted">
        I am a civil engineer with a passion for solving complex engineering challenges through data-driven insights and cutting-edge technologies. My extensive hands-on experience spans a wide range of research projects, from pavement engineering to infrastructure risk management, where I have developed a strong foundation in combining technical expertise with innovative solutions. I specialize in applying programming, machine learning, signal processing, and advanced data analytics to improve civil infrastructure systems, contributing to enhanced efficiency, safety, and sustainability.
	</p>
        <p class="text-muted">
        Throughout my career, I’ve worked on diverse projects, including road condition monitoring, pavement analysis, and structural health monitoring. I leverage advanced algorithms, big data analytics, and custom hardware systems to solve real-world problems, ensuring optimal performance and longevity of infrastructure. My tenure at the Department of Roads, Government of Nepal (2015-2024), provided me with significant experience in road and bridge construction, geotechnical investigations, and risk management. I was involved in the successful upgrading of national highways, local road networks, and bridges, where I applied my skills in risk assessment and management, construction monitoring, quality control, and bid evaluation to ensure quality and safety at every stage of the project. My technical expertise includes pavement design, surface dressing, slurry seal, semi-grout applications, and geotechnical engineering techniques such as slope stabilization, embankment construction, and sub-grade preparation. I am experienced in conducting geotechnical investigations and laboratory testing (including AIV, ACV, Proctor Compaction, and Field Density Assessments), as well as applying non-destructive testing (NDT) methods such as the Rebound Hammer and Pile Integrity tests. I have a strong focus on structural works, including road and bridge construction, shallow and deep foundation works, retaining walls, and geo-textile applications. My ability to manage complex construction projects while ensuring safety and adherence to quality standards has been a key strength in delivering impactful infrastructure solutions.
	</p>
        <p class="text-muted">
	Beyond my technical skills, I am motivated by curiosity and a drive to find creative, efficient solutions. I thrive on bridging the gap between traditional civil engineering and digital innovation. As a data science enthusiast, I focus on integrating advanced technologies into infrastructure systems to enhance their resilience and sustainability. With expertise in software tools such as QGIS, SW-Road, SW-DTM, AUTOCAD, SAP-2000, and statistical tools like SPSS and Python, I am committed to leveraging modern technologies for smarter infrastructure development. Holding a strong academic background in Civil Engineering and Construction Management from Pokhara University, Nepal, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth. By combining creativity, collaboration, and a results-oriented mindset, I aim to push the boundaries of civil engineering, contributing to the development of smarter, more resilient infrastructure systems.

        <p>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has caused social disruption and altered the global economic perspective. The construction sector plays an essential role in the worldwide economy, drawing upon a diverse array of resources within regional economies. Since the COVID-19 outburst in Nepal, it has been a really difficult task for the construction sector to initiate a project or to continue running at a normal pace.</p>
        <p>The objective of this research was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the road and bridge project under the road division Pokhara. About 52 respondents comprised contractors and client/consulting agencies at different structure questionnaires compatible with the requirement of the study were recorded. As a result, the eight most important factors were ranked based on the severity of the effect and prioritization of multiple factors on the project due to the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Obtained responses from consultant and contractor representatives, it was found that the factors beyond the control of projects, transportation shutdown were ranked first followed by the shortage of labor under manpower factor and others. This paper observes the actual severity of the various factors regarding construction projects due to the coronavirus and will also lead to better management in upcoming pandemics.</p>
        <p>The results of this study establish the groundwork for future researchers and practitioners by offering suggestions for how to prioritize and re-organize work plans, workplace management, and strategies for unforeseen circumstances.</p>

        <p>The evolution of road infrastructure is increasingly driven by the need for sustainability, resilience, and intelligent systems. This study explores the transformative shift from traditional flexible pavements to advanced smart pavement technologies.</p>
        <p>It provides a comparative analysis of Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA), Warm-Mix Asphalt (WMA), and Cold-Mix Asphalt (CMA), highlighting their environmental impacts, application conditions, and structural performance. Innovations such as bio-binders and recycled materials are examined for their potential in enhancing bitumen properties and reducing ecological footprints.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, alternative pavement types like inverted pavements and Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements (ICBP) are discussed for their structural benefits and adaptability to urban environments. The core focus lies on smart pavements, including self-healing asphalt and concrete, energy-harvesting surfaces, and sensor-integrated structures that enable real-time data interaction and proactive maintenance.</p>
        <p>Challenges related to durability, cost, and implementation of these technologies are also considered. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing smart pavement systems to meet future transportation demands sustainably and intelligently.</p>

        <p>In 2024, over 900,000 traffic crashes in Chicago were analyzed using CPD data and Python-based tools to uncover key trends and safety challenges. Notably, more than 700,000 crashes occurred under clear weather, highlighting the dominant role of driver behavior, infrastructure, and traffic volume over adverse weather.</p>
        <p>Crashes peaked in October, especially between 3–5 PM, with parked vehicle collisions and rear-end crashes being most common. Vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists faced higher injury risks, and over half the crashes occurred in areas lacking traffic controls.</p>
